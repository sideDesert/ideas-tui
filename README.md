# Ideas
An app to scribble down ideas in your terminal!

## Motivation
I love programming, and building new projects! One thing I always struggled with was keeping track of all project ideas I had. I use google notes to keep track of them, but a lot of times I would forget which account I used to note down my project ideas, it was convenient.
I thus creating this small script, in rust to keep track of project ideas. It's a TUI - so it is accessible from the terminal easily using a bash script!! This project is still a WIP , the more I flesh it out, the more I shall update this and the docs!

## V1 TODO
